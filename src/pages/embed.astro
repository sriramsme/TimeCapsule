// src/pages/embed.astro
// This is a dedicated embed page for iframe embeds
// It's separate from share.astro to provide a minimal, optimized embedding experience

// Import your layout (adjust path as needed)
import Layout from "@/layouts/Layout.astro";

// Import the EmbedViewer React component
import EmbedViewer from "@/components/EmbedViewer";
import Footer from "@/components/Footer.astro";
const title = "TimeCapsule Embed";
const description = "Embedded timeline view";

<Layout title={title}>
    <!-- 
    Use client:only="react" because EmbedViewer relies on browser APIs:
    - window.location for URL parameters
    - postMessage for auto-resize
    - MutationObserver for height detection
  -->
    <EmbedViewer client:only="react" />
</Layout>

<!--
  Alternative if you want a more minimal layout:
  
  Create src/layouts/EmbedLayout.astro with just the essentials,
  then use that instead of your main Layout.
  
  This would give you maximum control over the embed experience.
